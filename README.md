# Predicting hotel preferences from user query search

Repository for the Data Mining Techniques assignment (VU University Amsterdam, May 2017)

The goal of the project was to rank a number of hotels based on the probability of being booked. It combines data exploration, preprocessing, resampling, feature enginering and different machine learning models (including support vector machines, random forest, LambdaMART and coordinate ascent). Note that not all of the scripts are available in GitHub.  

It uses data from Kaggle competition "Personalize Expedia Hotel Searches - ICDM 2013".
